The [Caliper Analytics® Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at 
scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API™) for marshalling 
and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis 
and use.  

*caliper-ontology* provides machine-readable documents that define the concepts, relationships and 
constraints that together comprise the Caliper information model.  The ontology is available in 
three flavors: [JSON-LD](./caliper-jsonld.owl), [RDF/XML](./caliper-rdfxml.owl) and 
[Turtle](./caliper-turtle.owl).

## Branches
