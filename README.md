The *Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification* provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at scale.  Establishing a common vocabulary for describing learning interactions is a central objective.  Promoting data interoperability, data sharing and data-informed decision making are also important goals.

Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.

*caliper-ontology* provides a machine-readable document that defines the concepts, relationships and constraints that together comprise the Caliper information model.

## Document Syntax
*caliper-ontology* is available in three flavors: [JSON-LD](./caliper-jsonld.owl), [RDF/XML](./caliper-rdfxml.owl) and [Turtle](./caliper-turtle.owl).

## Branches
* __master__: stable, deployable branch that stores the official release history.  
* __develop__: unstable development branch.  Current work that targets a future release is merged to this branch.

## Tags
*caliper-ontology* releases are tagged and versioned MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\[-label\] (e.g., 1.1.0).  Pre-release tags are identified with an extensions label (e.g., "1.2.0-RC01").  The tags are stored in this repository.
